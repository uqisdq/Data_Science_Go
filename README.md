# Data_Science_Go
My collection of Data Science Learning Process

This repository is just my learning code for Data Science (I use these code for reference only)
The code was written in Jupyter Notebook, and I export it as HTML, so it's not excecutable
To see the code, just simply pull/download the code, and open it in your browser
To rerun the code, just copy the code per-kernel to your own Jupyter notebook

Thank you!
